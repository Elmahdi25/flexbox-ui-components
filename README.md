# flexbox-ui-components
A responsive subscription cards layout built with HTML and CSS only. 
This project helped me practice Flexbox alignment, equal-width layouts, nested flex containers, media queries, hover effects, gradients, and clean component structure , without copy-paste.
The initial layout idea was generated by ChatGPT, and the final implementation is my own result, built independently without step-by-step guidance.
